# Bicep Extension for Zed

This extension adds support for
[Bicep](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/) to
[Zed](https://zed.dev/).

## Pre-requisites

The Bicep language server is built in .NET, so requires the .NET runtime to be
installed. [.Net 8.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0) or
later is required. 8.0 is recommended as the latest LTS version.
